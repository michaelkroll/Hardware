## BTStack LE Arduino Shield

The BTStack LE Arduino Shield was developed in partnership with the BlueKitchen GmbH (@mringwal). 
The shield is available from Seeedstudio: http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/BTstack-LE-Arduino-Shield-p-2464.html 
and the Arduino Library is available at http://bluekitchen-gmbh.com/btstack-arduino/ which is needed to run the BTstack ported to 
the Arduino platform.
